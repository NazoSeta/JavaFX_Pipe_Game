# JavaFX_Pipe_Game

In this project we created a game called 'Pipe Game'. We did this with help of JavaFX. The target of this game is to let a ball roll from a starting point until an end point. We do this by creating a path with the given pipes.

The levels are made in a 4x4 matrix. Each spot has its own tile and can have a pipe or not. We can move the pipes based on their properties and whenever desired spot is free. Each time you create a line of pipes, the program checks whether this is suitable or not. If the line of pipes is suitable from the start until the end point, the program should activate the ball to roll. Only after you finish the level you will get the permission to go to the next level.

This progam teaches us the following:
- Usage of JavaFX
- Creating a game
- Animations
- Creating shapes
- Usage of BorderPane, HBox, ComboBox, etc.
- Usage of the interaction with the mouse
- How to upload images
- How to read from multiply files
- OOP
- Nested loops
